# QDB - Real-Time Database Service

QDB is a lightweight, general-purpose database service optimized for tracking and managing large-scale operations in real time. Built with performance and simplicity in mind, QDB provides a robust solution for applications requiring high-frequency data operations without the complexity and cost of traditional real-time databases.

## Overview

QDB is designed to efficiently handle millions of concurrent read and write operations, providing high availability and consistency without the need for expensive database infrastructure like Redis or Firebase. Leveraging SQLite as its backend, QDB offers efficient data storage and retrieval with the ability to perform complex queries while maintaining ACID compliance.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for low-latency operations with efficient indexing and query optimization
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity through atomic transactions and file-locking mechanisms
- **Concurrent Access**: Supports multiple simultaneous clients through sophisticated locking strategies
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Minimal resource footprint with no external dependencies
- **Flexible Schema**: Dynamic schema support for evolving data models
- **Selective Updates**: Granular control over data synchronization and updates

## Architecture

QDB's architecture is built around three core principles:

1. **Efficiency**: Optimized for high-frequency operations with minimal overhead
2. **Reliability**: Built-in data integrity and consistency guarantees
3. **Simplicity**: Easy integration and maintenance with minimal configuration

### Technical Implementation

- **Storage Engine**: SQLite-based backend for reliable data persistence
- **Concurrency Control**: File-based locking mechanism for safe concurrent access
- **Indexing System**: Optimized indexes for fast lookups and range queries
- **Query Optimizer**: Intelligent query planning for efficient data retrieval

## Use Cases

### Drone Fleet Management
- Real-time tracking of drone locations and status
- Mission planning and execution monitoring
- Battery and maintenance status tracking
- Fleet coordination and collision avoidance

### IoT Device Monitoring
- Device status and health monitoring
- Sensor data collection and analysis
- Alert management and threshold monitoring
- Device configuration and updates

### Logistics Tracking
- Real-time shipment location tracking
- Inventory management and optimization
- Route planning and optimization
- Delivery status monitoring

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Run production build:
```bash
npm start
```

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript (generated after build)
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (generated after npm install)

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Run the project in development mode using ts-node
- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript code
- `npm start` - Run the compiled JavaScript code
- `npm test` - Run tests (when implemented)

## Integration

QDB can be easily integrated into existing applications through its simple API:

```typescript
// Example usage
import { QDB } from 'qdb';

const db = new QDB({
  path: './data/database.sqlite',
  options: {
    concurrentWrites: true,
    autoIndex: true
  }
});

// Real-time updates
db.subscribe('drones', (update) => {
  console.log('Drone status updated:', update);
});

// Efficient queries
const activeDrones = await db.query('drones')
  .where('status', 'active')
  .select(['id', 'location', 'battery']);
```

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized for high-frequency read/write operations
- Efficient memory usage with streaming data processing
- Built-in connection pooling for better resource utilization
- Automatic query optimization and caching
